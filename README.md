Specifically, I only used half the space bar (I only hit space with my right thumb) and thus, a new can be used for the half I don't use. With this new key (I'll refer to it as fat function), I can add a new function key to access the function layer. 

On this function layer, I can add the numpad to it. Since I would be using my left thumb for function, this numpad could be put on my right hand (I'm right handed).

While the left handed numpad actually worked extremely well (the left hand somehow uses the same muscle memory as the right hand), it added to the length of the keyboard, which went against the
